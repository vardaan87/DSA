# 📘 DSA Learning Phases – Apna College

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository!  
This repo contains all the programs, solutions, and notes that I write while learning DSA, mainly following the **Apna College DSA course**.

  - Prime Numbers, GCD, etc.

- 🔢 **Arrays and Vectors**
  - Sorting, Searching
  - Prefix Sum, Sliding Window

- 🧵 **Strings**
  - Character Arrays vs Strings
  - Palindromes, Anagrams, etc.

- 📊 **2D Arrays and Matrices**
  - Spiral Traversal
  - Matrix Transposition

- 📚 **Linked List**
  - Singly & Doubly Linked Lists
